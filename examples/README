Gtk-fortran Example Programs
============================

This directory contains a number of example programs for the GTK 3 version of 
gtk-fortran.

The examples are automatically built by CMake but any example may also be 
individually built on a system with gtk-3-fortran installed with the command:

gfortran <name>.f90 -o <name> $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk-3-fortran)

Among those many examples:
- gtkzero.f90 just opens an empty GTK window.
- gtkhello.f90 opens a window with two buttons.
- The *pixbuf*.f90 examples demonstrate pixel drawing (bitmap drawing).
- The cairo*.f90 examples desmonstrate vectorial drawing using cairo.
- bazaar.f90 is used for testing various widgets and functions.
- hl_* examples uses the "high-level" interface.
- tests.f90 is testing things about ISO_C_BINDING and the relations between 
Fortran types and GLib types.
- ...
